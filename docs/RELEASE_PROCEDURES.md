## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

nu_plugin_ulid follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes or breaking changes
- **MINOR**: Backwards-compatible new features and functionality
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes and improvements

### Version Examples

```
0.1.0   - Initial development release
0.2.0   - Added new commands (minor)
0.2.1   - Bug fixes (patch)
1.0.0   - First stable release (major)
1.1.0   - New features (minor)
1.1.1   - Bug fixes (patch)
2.0.0   - Breaking changes (major)
```

### Pre-Release Versions

For pre-release versions, we use the following suffixes:

- **Alpha**: `1.0.0-alpha.1` - Early development, unstable
- **Beta**: `1.0.0-beta.1` - Feature complete, testing phase
- **Release Candidate**: `1.0.0-rc.1` - Stable, final testing

### Branch Strategy

- **main**: Stable, release-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for new features
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **release/***: Release preparation branches
- **hotfix/***: Critical bug fixes for production
