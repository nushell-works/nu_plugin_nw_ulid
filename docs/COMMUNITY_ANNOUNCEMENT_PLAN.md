# nu_plugin_nw_ulid: Production-grade ULID support for Nushell

I've just released nu_plugin_nw_ulid, a comprehensive ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) plugin for Nushell. This started as a learning project but evolved into something production-ready.

## What are ULIDs?

ULIDs are 128-bit identifiers that are:
- **Sortable**: Lexicographically sortable by generation time
- **Compact**: 26 character string representation
- **URL Safe**: No special characters
- **Monotonic**: Increasing within the same millisecond

Perfect for database primary keys, log correlation, and distributed system identifiers.

## Key Features

- **23 Production Commands**: Complete ULID ecosystem (generate, validate, parse, stream processing)
- **Enterprise Security**: A- security rating, cryptographically secure operations
- **High Performance**: ~40ns ULID generation, competitive with reference implementations
- **Nushell Native**: Seamless pipeline integration with structured data
- **Complete Automation**: Comprehensive scripting API with templates and examples

## Quick Example

```nushell
# Generate ULIDs
ulid generate --count 3

# Parse and analyze
echo "01K2W41TWG3FKYYSK430SR8KW6" | ulid parse

# Sort data by ULID timestamp
$data | ulid sort

# Stream processing for large datasets
$large_dataset | ulid stream validate --batch-size 1000
```

## Resources
